 * Get billing state

 * integration to know a write will be rejected before attempting it.
 *
 * This endpoint is read-only by construction. No API key of any kind can change a subscription, an
 * add-on quantity, or a payment method; there is no billing write endpoint and no billing write
 * scope. Stripe identifiers, invoices, and payment methods are never returned.
 *
 * Deployments without billing answer `200` with `billingEnabled: false`, a null plan, and null
 * limits, so callers need no special case.
